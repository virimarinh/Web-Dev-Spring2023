        /Users/virimarin/Desktop/WebDevelopment/Web-Dev-Spring2023/me.JPG
    I am a computer science major, second semester at New Paltz. Transferred from DCC where I got my Associates in Computer Science.  I have mostly worked with Java. I have taken CPS 1 – 3, Object Oriented Program as well as some Engineering classes. This semester I will be taking, Software Engineering, Web Development and Operating Systems. Where I’ll get more hands-on experience. When I started college, I was a nursing student and decided to switch, I had already taken a lot of the requisites, so I was able to take CPS 1 and 2 over the summer and CPS 3 on my last semester ad DCC with the remanding classes needed for my CS degree. I don’t have much experience creating my own projects yet. But I have started working and studying to be ready for the course load of this class. 

	I hope to use this course to get more experience with different languages and methods. To experience a different side of computer science. To see different things I am able to do and create.  From this course I want learn how to integrate and create websites and apps. To expand my knowledge on how websites work and hopefully get started on creating projects of my own. Having started my CS education a year ago, I feel a little bit behind than most having no previous coding experience so I’m excited to learn new things.
